# Probabilistic PDDL Solver for Block Stacking


This is the repository for term project of PKU 2024 Fall course **[Cognitive Reasoning](https://yzhu.io/courses/core/)**

## Project Requirements

- **Background**
  - Explore probabilistic PDDL solvers in the context of block stacking.
- **Objective**
  - Implement the solver and reproduce block stacking experiments.
- **Task Details**
  - Follow the experiments outlined in the paper by [Huang, De-An, et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06769).
- **Evaluation**
  - Validate the solverâ€™s performance in block stacking tasks.
